Here are all the scripts I used for the classification model on Compute Canada.

The two files "TrainRangerModel.r" and "UnsupervisedClassification.r" can be run locally on your computer. Before running them, ensure you download all the required data and update the file paths to match your local directory structure.

The other files, prefixed with "Compute", must be executed on Compute Canada servers using the sbatch command. Please ensure that all required data is correctly placed in the appropriate directories on Compute Canada.
